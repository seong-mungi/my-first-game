description: "Codex adapter for the original CCGS `dev-story` workflow. Canonical source: `.claude/skills/dev-story/SKILL.md`. Read a story file and implement it. Loads the full context (story, GDD requirement, ADR guidelines, control manifest), routes to the right programmer agent for the system and engine, implements the code and test, and confirms each acceptance criterion. The core implementation skill — run after /story-readiness, before /code-review and /story-done."

# Codex Adapter: `dev-story`

Canonical source: `../../../.claude/skills/dev-story/SKILL.md`

## How to use this adapter

1. Read the canonical source file before acting.
2. Follow its workflow in Codex.
3. Translate Claude-only constructs as follows:
   - `AskUserQuestion` -> ask the user directly only when blocked; otherwise continue with the narrowest safe assumption.
   - `Task` / subagents -> use Codex delegation only when the user explicitly requests parallel or delegated agent work.
   - `Write` / `Edit` -> use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
   - `Bash` -> use `exec_command` with minimal, verifiable commands.
   - `WebSearch` -> use `web` or Context7 with primary sources.
4. Treat `.claude/docs/*`, `.claude/rules/*`, and linked templates as canonical until a repo-local Codex-native replacement exists.
5. If the canonical source conflicts with repo `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md` first.

## Original description

Read a story file and implement it. Loads the full context (story, GDD requirement, ADR guidelines, control manifest), routes to the right programmer agent for the system and engine, implements the code and test, and confirms each acceptance criterion. The core implementation skill — run after /story-readiness, before /code-review and /story-done.

## Maintenance

- Do not edit this generated file directly.
- Update `.claude/skills/dev-story/SKILL.md` or `tools/sync_codex_adapters.py`, then run:

```bash
python3 tools/sync_codex_adapters.py
```
